//***************************************ARRAYS IN JS*********************************
//Define:In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays allow us to organize and manipulate data efficiently using various built-in methods.JavaScript arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element starts at index 0. Arrays are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink in size as needed. 

//Declaration of array
const myArr = [3,2,6,8,4,5]
console.log(myArr);
console.log(myArr[2]);

const myCartoons = ["osworld","noddy","shinchan"]
console.log(myCartoons);
console.log(myCartoons[1]);

const myArr2 = new Array(2,5,8,6,3) // Array method automatically convert elements into the array with [] brackets
console.log(myArr2);
