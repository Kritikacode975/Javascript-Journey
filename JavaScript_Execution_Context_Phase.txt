Define Js Execution context/phase:
        Define Js Execution context/phase means how to javascript run and executes the file. Js runs the file in two phase
        1)Global Execution Context 
        2)Functional Execution context
        3)Third is optional (Eval Execution Context): It is the property of global object

=> Js is single threaded.Inside the js everything is braces{}

=> How to Execute code js code (The code runs in two phase)

    [           ]
    [ { code }  ]===> 1) Memory Creation Phase (MCP)
    [ { code }  ]===> 2) Execution Phase
    [           ]  

Difference between MCP and EP:
    In memory creation phase there will be space which will allocate to variable, functions or      whatever we declared. There is only one memory allocation phase in memory creation.

    In execution phase we do mathematicl functions like add,sub,mul,div,executes


=> How to js put values in execution time

    Lets take an example:
        let val1 = 10
        let val2 = 5

        function addNum(num1,num2){
            let total = num1 + num2
            return total
        }
    
    let result1 = addNum(num1,num2)
    let result2 = addNum(10,4)

Note: We do step wise execution as per this code 

Step1-Global Execution/Environment:
    The code first runs in Global execution and the GE allocated into the (this).It is compulsory in js

Step2-Memory Creation Phase:
    In MCP we collect all the variables inside it.In MCP first step is to put all the variables inside MCP and name them undefined

    -> pointing to the above code which we written
        val1 = undefined
        val2 = undefined
        addNum = defination(code inside the function)
        result1 = undefined
        result2 = undefined

    Note:This is the first cycle

Step3-Execution Phase:
    val1 = 10
    val2 = 5                           This is the addNum diffrent execution context
    addNum                             [ New variable ] 
                                       [ Environment  ]
                                       [       +      ] ==>New execution context
                                       [    Execution ] 
                                       [      Thread  ]
                                               |
                                        [Delete after word]

                        ==> This is the new send box so that we repeat again MCP and execution phase
                        and these two are executed for addNum

                        ==> This new executed context will be delete once its completes the work

Note: Whenever new function defines this two phases repeats the execution. The global execution phase is defines only one time

  ==> repeat the process with MCP and execution phase
  1) MCP                                               2)execution phase
    val1 = undefined                                        num1 = 10
    val2 = undefined                                        num2 = 5
    total = undefined                                       total = 15

    ==>This total value (15) is return to the global execution and this cycle repeats evertym
